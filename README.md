Website that I have created

Hello!

I have put all my HMTL/CSS/JavaScript code onto github. If you want to see the final product please press the link below.
The website is currently being hosted under a sub domain from a third party hosting service: 000webHost <- Amazing Btw
https://acwebs557.000webhostapp.com/index.html#about.

Enjoy.

Edit: The files are not carbon copies as the one on 000webHost, files had to be edited within the host server 
in order to best showcase the web depending on the resolutions. <-- This is not perfect either.

Edit: Currently using Netify to host the web.
